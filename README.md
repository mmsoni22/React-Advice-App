# Advice App
The purpose of the project was to learn about react and class based component in React. By using React Coponents and lifecycle method I created a web app, in which the data is fetched using Advice slip API when the button is clicked. 
By using CoponentDidMount, I  intially fetch data and show an advice when page is rendered. 

## Axios
I have used axios to make promise based HTTP request.
